## Visualisations

### Geo Hurricane

This visualisation allows one to visualise hurricanes path through time using the bottom slider. Hurricanes color can be adjusted to represent hurricanes wind intensity, pressure or seasons.

### Hurricane Winds

One can use this line chart to display and compare many hurricane's durations and wind intensity evolution at the same time.

### Planet heating

Can help to visualy search for correlation between our planet's temperature and the annual hurricanes amount.

## DataSets

This project is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) DataSets.

 * [IBTrACS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/) (International Best Track Archives Climate Stewardhship). This DataSet provides wind intensity and pressure mesures for each hurricane
 
 * [Billions](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions) DataSet. This DataSet provides informations about human and material damage.
 
 * [GTTS](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp) Global Temperature Time Series DataSet. This DataSet provides informations about our eath's planet through time.
 
 
Due to an unexpected shutdown from the U.S. Government, all DataSets from the NOAA administration are unavailable at this date.
